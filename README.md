## General Information
This task aims to implement the formation of Bézier curves using the divide and conquer midpoint algorithm. Bézier curves are smooth curves commonly used in graphic design, animation, and manufacturing. This algorithm enables the formation of Bézier curves with high precision through an iterative approach.


## Technologies Used
- Python 3.11.5


## Setup
`pip install tkinter`
`pip install time`

## How To Run
`python main.py`
